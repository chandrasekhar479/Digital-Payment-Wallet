Check for Missing Users:
The code ensures that both the sender and the receiver exist in the database.
If either sender or receiver is missing (e.g., invalid user ID), the server responds with an HTTP status 404 (Not Found) and an error message.
Check for Sufficient Balance:
Verifies that the sender has enough balance to make the transfer.
If the sender's balance is less than the amount to be transferred, the server responds with HTTP status 400 (Bad Request) and an error message indicating "Insufficient balance."
Update Balances:
Deducts the transfer amount from the sender's balance.
Adds the same amount to the receiver's balance.
Save Updated Balances to the Database:
Saves the updated balances for both the sender and the receiver to the database.
These are asynchronous operations, so await ensures that they complete before moving to the next step.

Log the Transaction:
Creates a new transaction record to log the transfer.
sender._id: ID of the sender.
receiver._id: ID of the receiver.
amount: Amount transferred.
Saves this transaction record to the database for future reference or auditing.
Send Success Response:
Sends an HTTP status 200 (OK) response to the client, along with a success message indicating that the transfer was completed.
Handle Errors:
Wraps the entire logic in a try-catch block to handle unexpected errors.
If an error occurs at any point (e.g., database connection issues, invalid input), the server responds with an HTTP status 500 (Internal Server Error) and a generic error message.
